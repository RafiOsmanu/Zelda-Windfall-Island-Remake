# Zelda Windwaker Remake

## Introduction

This project is a brief reinterpretation of "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker," with the action set on the charming Windfall Island. This README will guide you through the project and its features.

## Basic Mechanics

In this reinterpretation, you will find some of the basic mechanics present, including movement, rolling, and in my case, a controllable jump. The primary goal of the game is to break all the barrels scattered throughout Windfall Island by rolling into them.

## Technical Details

This project showcases various technical features, all implemented in C++ within an engine provided by DAE (Digital Arts and Entertainment). Here are some of the technical highlights:

- **Geometry Shader:** Utilizes a geometry shader to enhance rendering and create complex geometric shapes.
- **Sprite Rendering:** Implements sprite rendering techniques for 2D elements.
- **Animation Skinning:** Includes animation skinning for lifelike character movements and accurate shadows when implementing shadow mapping.
- **Shadow Mapping:** The game incorporates advanced shadow mapping techniques to enhance the visual experience and create realistic lighting and shadows.
- **Simple Post-Processing:** Provides post-processing effects, such as a dark filter when the game is paused for improved visual aesthetics.
- **Text Rendering:** Implements text rendering for in-game UI elements.
- **Skybox:** A skybox has been integrated to provide an immersive environment.
- **Water Shader:** The project showcases a bespoke water shader that dynamically emulates the playful characteristics of cartoon-style water.
- **Particles:** A particle system has been implemented to bring life to the world, adding dynamic elements and visual flair.
