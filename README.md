<h1>Zelda Windwaker Remake</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project is a brief reinterpretation of "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker," with the action set on the charming Windfall Island. This README will guide you through the project and its features.</p>

<h2>Basic Mechanics</h2>
<p>In this reinterpretation, you will find some of the basic mechanics present, including movement, rolling, and in my case a controllable jump. The primary goal of the game is to break all the barrels scattered throughout Windfall Island by rolling into them.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>This project showcases various technical features, all implemented in C++ within an engine provided by DAE (Digital Arts and Entertainment). Here are some of the technical highlights:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Geometry Shader:</strong> Utilizes a geometry shader to enhance rendering and create complex geometric shapes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sprite Rendering:</strong> Implements sprite rendering techniques for 2D elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Animation Skinning:</strong> Includes animation skinning for lifelike character movements and accurate shadows when implemnting shadowmapping.</li>
    <li><strong>Shadow Mapping:</strong> The game incorporates advanced shadow mapping techniques to enhance the visual experience and create realistic lighting and shadows.</li>
    <li><strong>Simple Post-Processing:</strong> Provides post-processing effects, such as blur, when the game is paused for improved visual aesthetics.</li>
    <li><strong>Text Rendering:</strong> Implements text rendering for in-game UI elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Skybox:</strong> A skybox has been integrated to provide an immersive environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Water Shader:</strong> The project showcases a bespoke water shader that dynamically emulates the playful characteristics of cartoon-style water.</li>
    <li><strong>Particles:</strong> A particle system has been implemented to bring life to the world, adding dynamic elements and visual flair.</li>
</ul>
